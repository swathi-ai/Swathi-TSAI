The Assignment is on MNIST dataset focusing on 
             1. normalization techniques like Batch normalization, Group normalization and Layer normalization. 
             2. Regularization techniques like L1 is used and
             3. It aims to learn modular code development
             
 Hence the project consists of two files namely 
          1. model.py where model is defined
          2. mian.py where data is loaded and model is called on this data
          
**Model with Group Normalization**
As a first step, model is defined with group normalization

**Model with Layer Normalization**
As a first step, model is defined with Layer normalization

**Model with L1 + Batch Normalization**
As a first step, model is defined with L1 with Batch normalization

**Graphs**
**Test/Validation Loss for all above 3 models together**


**Test/Validation Accuracy for 3 models together**


**10 misclassified images for model with Group Normalization**
